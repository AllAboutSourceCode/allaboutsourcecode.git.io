Hi, Monkseven here. This page primarily devoted for the quick introduction and links for tools which can be useful while developing and maintaining a software. Have a great learning!

### CodeAnalyzer

It is a static analysis tool, developed as an Eclipse Plugin, to assist developers identify code smells and suggest various refactorings. At present support for Extract Method Refactoring only is available. 
Tool can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/monkseven/codeAnalyzer/blob/master/codeAnalyzer_1.0.0.202101201055.jar?raw=true), as a jar file. After downloading place it in the 'plugins' directory of your Eclipse and restart it (if already running). Once, restarted you should notice a new menu titled 'codeanalyzer' to menu bar. There you go.
